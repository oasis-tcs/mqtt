# Contributions Area

Below this path /contributions/ the maintainers can receive and organize contributions from external parties to the MQTT TC as well as
snapshots from external editor editing systems.

To clearly identify the contribution sources, the contributions are stored within folders naming the sources.

## Snapshots

For the constrained access initial editoring system this is the folder /contributions/snapshots/.

Any snapshot is stored in a folder exposing the date of the extraction in ISO format like /contributions/snapshots/2025-10-23/.
