# Proof of Concept latest WD for Progression

This folder will provide the proof of concept variants of the latest WD for progression.

There may be two markdown files:

- one clean file for starting the progression to OASIS Standard as source (possibly later cut into sevaral per section files)
- one FutHub online rendering to HTML optimized user facing delivery item in markdown plus some extras that GitHub brings to good use like navigation and mark highlight parts in HTML
