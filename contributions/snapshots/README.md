# README - /contributions/snapshots/

This folder contains the snapshots in yyyy-mm-dd named folders taken from the editing system (google docs) by one of the editors (Stefan Hagen).
taken at various moments in time in some formats as offered by that platform over time.

The formats (as identified by the suffixes) .docx, .odt, .pdf, and .txt were initially available as a zipped .html format.

Later snapshots also contain a .md (markdown) export as offered by that platform.

## Processing Notes

- When the downloaded plain text (.txt) format file contained a BOM, this was cleansed.
- Any Windows style line endings (carriage return + newline) in text-like files were replaced with plain newlines.
- The downloaded HTML + images folder zip file was unpacked.
- Observation: The images for HTML format are numbered and the numbering is not matching the numbering of meadia
  items in the markdown exports offered later by the editorial private platform.
