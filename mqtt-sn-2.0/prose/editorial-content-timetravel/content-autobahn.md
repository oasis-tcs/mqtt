**Abstract:**

This specification defines the MQTT for Sensor Networks protocol (MQTT-SN). It is closely related to the MQTT v3.1.1 and MQTT v5.0 standards. MQTT-SN
is optimized for implementation on low-cost, battery-operated devices with limited processing and storage resources. It is designed so that it will
work over a variety of networking technologies and bridge to an MQTT network.

## 1.1 MQTT For Sensor Networks (MQTT-SN)  {#mqtt-for-sensor-networks-mqtt-sn .unnumbered}

Sensor Networks are simple, low cost and easy to deploy, they are typically used to provide, event detection, monitoring, automation, process control
and more. Sensor Networks often comprise of many battery-powered sensors and actuators, each containing a limited amount of storage and processing
capability. They usually communicate wirelessly.

Sensor Networks are self-forming, continually change, and do not have any central control. The wireless network connections and processing nodes will
fail, and the batteries will run out. The nodes will be replaced, added or removed in an unplanned way. The identities of the devices are usually
created when they are manufactured, this avoids the need for specialist configuration when they are deployed. Applications running outside the Sensor
Network do not need to know the details of the devices in it. The applications consume information from the sensors and send instructions to actuators
based only on labels created by the application designers. The labels are called Topic Names in the MQTT and MQTT-SN protocols. The MQTT-SN
implementation carries the information between a set of applications and the correct set of devices based on its knowledge of the network and the
applications designer's choice of Topic Names.

Consider an example of a medicine tracking application. The application needs to know the location and temperature of the medicine, but it does not
want to concern itself with the network details of the devices providing the data. It may be that the number and types of the devices changes over
time. There may also be other applications using the same sensor data for other purposes. The model is that the devices and applications produce and
consume data to and from the Topics rather than the other devices and applications.

This MQTT-SN specification is a variant of the MQTT version 5 specification. It is adapted to exploit low power and low bandwidth wireless networks.
Low power wireless radio links have higher numbers of transmission errors compared to more powerful networks because they are more susceptible to
interference and fading of the radio signals. They also have lower transmission rates.

For example, wireless networks based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard used by Zigbee have a maximum bandwidth of 250 kbit/s in the 2.4 GHz band. To
reduce transmission errors the packets are kept short. The maximum packet length at the physical layer is 128 bytes and half of these may be used for
Media Access Control and security.

The MQTT-SN protocol is optimized for implementation on low-cost, battery-operated devices with limited processing and storage resources. The
capabilities are kept simple and the specification allows partial implementations.

### 1.1.1 MQTT-SN and MQTT Differences {#mqtt-sn-and-mqtt-differences .unnumbered}

MQTT and MQTT-SN specifications are similar in many ways and meant to interoperate with each other, but the two specifications are independent of each
other.

MQTT-SN can work isolated from other networks or in conjunction with MQTT. The main differences between MQTT-SN and MQTT are:

1.  MQTT-SN uses separate packets to transfer the Will Topic and Will Payload if they are used. The Will Topic and Will Payload can be modified during
    the lifetime of a Session.

2.  In addition to Topic Alias and long Topic Names MQTT-SN allows predefined and short two-byte Topic Names.

3.  If the network supports multicast, Gateway discovery can be implemented, otherwise the Gateway addresses must be configured in the nodes.

4.  The Will message is part of the Session State and is discarded as part of Clean Start processing.

5.  Support for sleeping clients allows battery operated devices to enter a low power mode. In this state, messages for the client are buffered by the
    Gateway and delivered when the client wakes.

6.  A new Quality of Service level (OUT OF BAND) is introduced in MQTT-SN, allowing devices to publish without a GW session having been established.

7.  MQTT-SN doesn't have any requirement on the underlying transport and it can use connectionless network transports such as User Datagram Protocol
    (UDP).

8.  MQTT-SN introduced the Protection packet for message-based security based on symmetric cryptography.

Text describing the changes/differences

###  {#section .unnumbered}

## 1.3 Organization of the MQTT-SN specification {#organization-of-the-mqtt-sn-specification .unnumbered}

The specification is split into seven chapters:

-   [Chapter](#_heading=h.2bxgwvm) 1 -- Introduction

-   Chapter 2 -- MQTT-SN Control Packet format

-   Chapter 3 -- MQTT-SN Control Packet listing

-   Chapter 4 -- Operational Behavior

-   Chapter 5 -- Conformance

## 1.4 Glossary {#glossary .unnumbered}

**Application Message:**

The data carried by the MQTT-SN protocol across the network for the application. When an Application Message is transported by MQTT-SN it contains
payload data, a Quality of Service (QoS) and a Topic Name.

**Client:**

A program or device that uses MQTT-SN. A Client:

-   Optionally Connects to the Gateway

-   publishes Application Messages to topics.

-   subscribes to request Application Messages that it is interested in receiving.

-   unsubscribes to remove a request for Application Messages.

-   Issues a DISCONNECT to the Gateway.

**Gateway (abbrev. GW):**

A program or device accepting MQTT-SN protocol packets from Clients. A Gateway:

-   accepts CONNECT packets from Clients and initializes Sessions.

-   accepts Application Messages published by Clients and sends them to the Server.

-   processes Subscribe and Unsubscribe requests from Clients.

-   forwards Application Messages from the Server to Clients.

-   maintains a Gateway "Session" for each Client on the GW.

-   maintains a dictionary of topic alias's for each Client.

**Server or Broker:**

A program or device accepting MQTT protocol connections from the Gateways. A Server or Broker:

-   accepts Network Connections from Gateways.

-   Ultimately accepts Application Messages published by Clients.

-   processes Subscribe and Unsubscribe requests from Clients.

-   forwards Application Messages that match Client Subscriptions to the Gateways.

-   closes the Network Connection from the Gateway.

**Session:**

[A session is the shared state between client and gateway.]{.mark}

**Unicast:**

**Multicast:**

**Virtual Connection:**

Carries the MQTT-SN data between a Client and a Gateway, or a multicast to all Gateways and all clients.

Refer to section 3.2 Networks & Transport Layers for informative examples.

**Subscription:**

A Subscription comprises a Topic Filter and a maximum QoS. A Subscription is associated with a single Session. A Session can contain more than one
Subscription. Each Subscription within a Session has a different Topic Filter.

**Topic Alias:**

A topic alias is a 16-bit unsigned integer assigned by the Gateway during a session or pre-assigned by the application which represents and replaces a
topic name or topic filter in the protocol packets.

**Topic Name:**

The label attached to an Application Message which is matched against the Subscriptions known to the Gateway / Server.

**Topic Filter:**

An expression contained in a Subscription to indicate an interest in one or more topics. A Topic Filter can include wildcard characters.

**Wildcard Subscription:**

A Wildcard Subscription is a Subscription with a Topic Filter containing one or more wildcard characters. This allows the subscription to match more
than one Topic Name.

**Control Packet:**

A packet of information that is sent across the Virtual Connection. The MQTT-SN specification defines 31 (twenty nine) different types of MQTT-SN
Control Packet, for example the PUBLISH packet is used to convey Application Messages.

**Wireless Sensor Networks (abbrev. WSN):**

N[etworks of spatially dispersed and dedicated sensors that monitor and record the physical conditions of the environment and forward the collected
data to a central location.]{.mark}

###  {#section-2 .unnumbered}

## 1.4 Data representation {#data-representation .unnumbered}

### 1.4.1 Bits (Byte) {#bits-byte .unnumbered}

Bits in a byte are labeled 7 to 0. Bit number 7 is the most significant bit, the least significant bit is assigned bit number 0.

### 1.4.2 Two Byte Integer {#two-byte-integer .unnumbered}

Two Byte Integer data values are 16-bit unsigned integers in big-endian order: the high order byte precedes the lower order byte. This means that a
16-bit word is presented on the network as Most Significant Byte (MSB), followed by Least Significant Byte (LSB).

### 1.4.3 Four Byte Integer {#four-byte-integer .unnumbered}

Four Byte Integer data values are 32-bit unsigned integers in big-endian order: the high order byte precedes the successively lower order bytes. This
means that a 32-bit word is presented on the network as Most Significant Byte (MSB), followed by the next most Significant Byte (MSB), followed by the
next most Significant Byte (MSB), followed by Least Significant Byte (LSB).

### 1.4.4 UTF-8 Encoded String {#utf-8-encoded-string .unnumbered}

Text fields within the MQTT-SN Control Packets are encoded as fixed length UTF-8 strings.
UTF-8Â [\[RFC3629\]](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/cos02/mqtt-v5.0-cos02.html#RFC3629)Â is an efficient encoding of
UnicodeÂ [\[Unicode\]](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/cos02/mqtt-v5.0-cos02.html#Unicode)Â characters that optimizes the encoding of ASCII
characters in support of text-based communications.

Â 

Unless stated otherwise all variable length UTF-8 encoded strings can have any length in the range 0 to 65,535 bytes.

# 2 MQTT-SN Control Packet format {#mqtt-sn-control-packet-format .unnumbered}

## 2.1 Structure of an MQTT-SN Control Packet {#structure-of-an-mqtt-sn-control-packet .unnumbered}

The MQTT-SN protocol operates by exchanging a series of MQTT-SN Control Packets in a defined way. This section describes the format of these packets.

An MQTT-SN Control Packet consists of up to two parts, always in the following order as shown below.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Control Packet Header, present in all MQTT-SN Control Packets
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Control Packet Variable Part, present in some MQTT-SN Control Packets

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Table 3: Structure of an MQTT-SN Control Packet]{.underline}

### 2.1.1 Packet Header {#packet-header .unnumbered}

Each MQTT-SN Control Packet contains a Header of format 1 or format 2 as shown below.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Byte**                 **Use**
  ------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Table 5: Packet Header Format 2]{.underline}

### 2.1.2 Length {#length .unnumbered}

The *Length* field is either 1-byte or 3-byte integer and specifies the total number of bytes contained in the packet (including the *Length* field
itself).

If the first byte of the *Length* field is coded "0x01" then the *Length* field is 3-bytes long; in this case, the two following bytes specify the
total number of bytes of the packet (most-significant byte first). Otherwise, the *Length* field is only 1-byte long and specifies itself the total
number of bytes contained in the packet.

The 3-byte format allows the encoding of packet lengths up to 65,535 bytes. Packets with lengths up to and including 255 bytes MUST use the shorter
byte format.

**Informative comment**

> MQTT-SN does not support packet fragmentation and reassembly, the maximum packet length that could be used in a network is governed by the maximum
> packet size that is supported by that network, and not by the maximum length that could be encoded by MQTT-SN.

### 2.1.3 MQTT-SN Control Packet Type {#mqtt-sn-control-packet-type .unnumbered}

The MQTT-SN Control Packet Type field is 1-byte long and specifies the MQTT-SN Control Packet type which is one of the values shown below.

[Table 8 Packets with Packet Identifier]{.underline}

[A PUBLISH packet MUST NOT contain a Packet Identifier if its QoS value is set to 0]{.mark}.

[A PUBLISH packet MUST NOT contain a Packet Identifier if its QoS value is set to]{.mark} -1.

[Each time a Client sends a new SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE,or PUBLISH (where QoS \> 0 and it is not OUT OF BAND) MQTT Control Packet it MUST assign it a
non-zero Packet Identifier that is currently unused]{.mark}.

[Each time a Gateway sends a new PUBLISH (with QoS \> 0) MQTT-SN Control Packet it MUST assign it a non zero Packet Identifier that is currently
unused]{.mark}.

The Packet Identifier becomes available for reuse after the sender has processed the corresponding acknowledgement packet, defined as follows. In the
case of a QoS 1 PUBLISH, this is the corresponding PUBACK; in the case of QoS 2 PUBLISH it is PUBCOMP or a PUBREC with a Reason Code of 128 or
greater. For SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE it is the corresponding SUBACK or UNSUBACK.

Packet Identifiers used with PUBLISH, SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE packets form a single, unified set of identifiers separately for the Client and the
Gateway in a Session. A Packet Identifier cannot be used by more than one command at any time.

[A PUBACK, PUBREC , PUBREL, or PUBCOMP packet MUST contain the same Packet Identifier as the PUBLISH packet that was originally sent. A SUBACK and
UNSUBACK MUST contain the Packet Identifier that was used in the corresponding SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE packet respectively.]{.mark}

The Client and Gateway assign Packet Identifiers independently of each other. As a result, Client-Server pairs can participate in concurrent message
exchanges using the same Packet Identifiers.

> **Informative comment**
>
> It is possible for a Client to send a PUBLISH packet with Packet Identifier 0x1234 and then receive a different PUBLISH packet with Packet
> Identifier 0x1234 from its Server before it receives a PUBACK for the PUBLISH packet that it sent.

## 2.3 MQTT-SN Packet Fields {#mqtt-sn-packet-fields .unnumbered}

### 2.3.1 Protocol Id {#protocol-id .unnumbered}

The *Protocol Id* is 1-byte long. It is only present in a CONNECT packet and corresponds to the MQTT 'protocol name' and 'protocol version'.

It is coded 0x02. 0x01 was used for MQTT-SN 1.2. All other values are reserved.

### 2.3.2 Radius {#radius .unnumbered}

The *Radius* field is 1-byte long and indicates the value of the transmission radius. The value 0x00 means "send to all nodes in the network".

### 2.3.3 Reason Code {#reason-code .unnumbered}

A Reason Code is a one-byte long value that indicates the result of an operation.Â Reason Codes share a common set of values across the various Control
Packet types.

Each value and meaning of each *Reason Code* field is shown below.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Table 11: ADVERTISE Packet]{.underline}

The ADVERTISE packet is sent periodically by the gateway to advertise its presence. The time interval until the next transmission is indicated by the
*Duration* field.

**Informative comment**

If UDP is used as transport protocol, the ADVERTISE packet is generally sent using the broadcast address as destination.

#### 3.1.1.1 Length & Packet Type {#length-packet-type .unnumbered}

The first 2 or 4 bytes of the packet are encoded according to the variable length packet header format. Please refer to section 1.8.2 for a detailed
description.

#### 3.1.1.2 GwId {#gwid .unnumbered}

The *GwId* field is at least 1-byte identifier and uniquely identifies a gateway which is advertising itself in the network.

The MQTT-SN protocol itself doesn't guarantee the uniqueness of the *GwId* field.

**Informative comment**

If the Gateway has a MAC address, it can be used as *GwId*.

#### 3.1.1.3 Duration {#duration .unnumbered}

The *Duration* field is a 2-byte integer. It specifies the time interval in seconds until the next ADVERTISE packet is transmitted by this gateway
period.

The maximum value that can be encoded is approximately 18 hours.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Table 12: SEARCHGW packet]{.underline}

The SEARCHGW packet is sent by a client when it searches for a Gateway. The transmission radius of the SEARCHGW is limited and depends on the density
of the clients deployment, e.g. only 1-hop transmission in case of a very dense network in which every MQTT-SN client is reachable from each other
within 1-hop transmission.

#### 3.1.2.1 Length & Packet Type {#length-packet-type-1 .unnumbered}

The first 2 or 4 bytes of the packet are encoded according to the variable length packet header format. Please refer to section 1.8.2 for a detailed
description.

#### 3.1.2.2 Radius {#radius-1 .unnumbered}

The transmission radius is also indicated to the underlying network layer when MQTT-SN gives this packet for transmission.

A Client or a Gateway MUST NOT forward the SEARCHGW received if the Radius value is 0.

If a Client or a Gateway forwards the SEARCHGW received, it MUST reduce the Radius value by 1.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Table 13: GWINFO packet]{.underline}

The GWINFO packet is sent as response to a SEARCHGW packet with the radius as indicated in the SEARCHGW packet. If sent by a Gateway, it contains only
the id of the sending Gateway; otherwise, if sent by a client, it also includes the address of the Gateway.

#### 3.1.3.1 Length & Packet Type {#length-packet-type-2 .unnumbered}

The first 2 or 4 bytes of the packet are encoded according to the variable length packet header format. Please refer to section 1.8.2 for a detailed
description.

#### 3.1.3.2 GwId {#gwid-1 .unnumbered}

The *GwId* field is 1-byte long and uniquely identifies a Gateway in the network.

#### 3.1.3.3 GwAdd {#gwadd .unnumbered}

The *GwAdd* field has a variable length and contains the address of a Gateway. Its length depends on the type of network over which MQTT-SN operates
and is specified by the Length byte. Optional, only included if the packet is sent by a client.

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Table 14: CONNECT packet]{.underline}

The CONNECT packet is sent from the Client to the Gateway to set up a session.

#### 3.1.4.1 Length & Packet Type {#length-packet-type-3 .unnumbered}

The first 2 or 4 bytes of the packet are encoded according to the variable length packet header format. Please refer to section 1.8.2 for a detailed
description.

#### 3.1.4.2 Connect Flags {#connect-flags .unnumbered}

The Connect Flags is 1 byte field which contains several parameters specifying the behavior of the MQTT-SN Virtual Connection.

The Connect *Flags* field includes the following flags:

-   **Clean Start:** Stored in Bit 0 and specifies whether the Virtual Connection starts a new Session or is a continuation of an existing Session

-   **Will**:Â Stored in Bit 1 and if set to 1 it indicates that client is asking for Will topic and Will message prompting

-   **Authentication**: Stored in Bit 2 and indicates the authentication exchange to follow

-   **Default Awake Messages**: A value between 0-15 to indicate the maximum number of messages a client shall receive during an AWAKE session.
    Specifying 0 will mean it is up to the gateway to determine how many messages it will send, which may be unbounded.

> The Gateway MUST validate that the reserved flags in the CONNECT packet are set to 0. If any of the reserved flags is not 0 it is a Malformed
> Packet.

#### 3.1.4.3 Protocol Version {#protocol-version .unnumbered}

The one-byte unsigned value that represents the revision level of the protocol used by the Client.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Protocol Version**                                                       **Value**
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Version 1.2                                                                0x01

  **Version 2.0**                                                            **0x02**

  Reserved for future versions                                               0x03 -- 0xFF
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Table 15: Protocol version values]{.underline}

[The value of the Protocol Version field for MQTT-SN version 2.0 MUST be 2 (0x02).]{.mark}

A Gateway which supports multiple versions of the MQTT-SN protocol uses the Protocol Version to determine which version of MQTT-SN the Client is
using. If the Protocol Version is valid but it is not the latest one available (for instance 0x02) and the Gateway does not want to accept the CONNECT
packet, the Server MAY send a CONNACK packet with Reason Code 0x84 (Unsupported Protocol Version) and consider the session closed.

#### 3.1.4.4 Keep Alive Timer {#keep-alive-timer .unnumbered}

The Keep Alive is a Two Byte Integer greater than 0 (1 - 65,535), which is a time interval measured in seconds. It is the maximum time interval that
is permitted to elapse between the point at which the Client finishes transmitting one MQTT-SN Control Packet and the point it starts sending the
next. It is the responsibility of the Client to ensure that the interval between MQTT Control Packets being sent does not exceed the Keep Alive
value.Â In the absence of sending any other MQTT-SN Control Packets, the Client MUST send a PINGREQ packet.

> **Informative comment**
>
> The Client can send PINGREQ at any time, irrespective of the Keep Alive value, and check for a corresponding PINGRESP to determine that the network
> and the Gateway are available.

[If the Gateway does not receive an MQTT-SN Control Packet from the Client within one and a half times the Keep Alive time period, it MUST consider
the session 'LOST' (see state description in table 3.6).]{.mark}

[If a Client does not receive a PINGRESP packet within a *Tretry* amount of time after it has sent a PINGREQ, it SHOULD retry the transmission
according to B4 up to the max attempts. If a PINGRESP is still not received it MUST close the Session to the Gateway by way of a DISCONNECT, with the
understanding that the GW may no longer be reachable.]{.mark}

[A Keep Alive must have a value greater than 0. It is considered a protocol error If a Keep Alive value of 0 is set.]{.mark}

Â 

> **Informative comment**\
> The Gateway may have other reasons to disconnect the Client, for instance because it is shutting down. Setting Keep Alive does not guarantee that
> the Client will remain connected.

Â 

> **Informative comment**
>
> The actual value of the Keep Alive is application specific; typically, this is a few minutes. The maximum value of 65,535 is 18 hours 12 minutes and
> 15 seconds.

#### 3.1.4.5 Session Expiry Interval {#session-expiry-interval .unnumbered}

The Session Expiry Interval is a four-byte integer time interval measured in seconds. If the Session Expiry Interval is set to 0, the Session ends
(and state deleted) when a (non SLEEPING) DISCONNECT packet is sent from either the client or gateway.

If the Session Expiry Interval is 0xFFFFFFFF (UINT_MAX), the Session does not expire.

[The Client and Gateway MUST store the Session State after a DISCONNECT is issued if the Session Expiry Interval is greater than 0.]{.mark}

> **Informative comment**
>
> The clock in the Client or Gateway may not be running for part of the time interval, for instance because the Client or Gateway are not running.
> This might cause the deletion of the state to be delayed.
>
> **Informative comment**
>
> The client and gateway between them should negotiate a reasonable and practical session expiry interval according to the network and infrastructure
> environment in which they are deployed. For example, it would not be practical to set a session -- expiry -- interval of many months on a gateway
> whose hardware is only capable of storing a few client sessions.

#### 3.1.4.6 Max Packet Size {#max-packet-size .unnumbered}

A Two Byte (16-bit) Integer representing the Maximum Packet Size the Client is willing to accept. If the Maximum Packet Size is set to 0, no limit on
the packet size is imposed beyond the limitations in the protocol as a result of the remaining length encoding and the protocol header sizes.

> **Informative comment**
>
> It is the responsibility of the application to select a suitable Maximum Packet Size value if it chooses to restrict the Maximum Packet Size.

Â 

The packet size is the total number of bytes in an MQTT Control Packet, as defined in section 3.1. The Client uses the Maximum Packet Size to inform
the Server that it will not process packets exceeding this limit.

Â 

[The Gateway MUST NOT send packets exceeding Maximum Packet Size to the Client.Â If a Client receives a packet whose size exceeds this limit, this is a
Protocol Error, the Client uses DISCONNECT with Reason Code 0x95 (Packet too large).]{.mark}

Â 

[Where a Packet is too large to send, the Gateway MUST discard it without sending it and then behave as if it had completed sending that Application
Message.]{.mark}

> Â 
>
> **Informative comment**
>
> Where a packet is discarded without being sent, the Gateway could place the discarded packet on a 'dead letter queue' or perform other diagnostic
> action. Such actions are outside the scope of this specification.

#### 3.1.4.7 Client Identifier {#client-identifier .unnumbered}

The Client Identifier (ClientID) identifies the Client to the Gateway. Each Client connecting to the Gateway has a unique ClientID.Â [The ClientID MUST
be used by Clients and by Gateway to identify the state that they hold relating to this MQTT-SN Session between the Client and the Gateway]{.mark}.

> **Informative comment**
>
> A Client Identifier can be between 0 - 65,521 bytes. We advise for practicality, ClientID's are restricted to a reasonable size (less than 243 bytes
> to fit within a small CONNECT packet).

[When the clientID is present (greater than 0 bytes), the Gateway MUST allow values which are between 1 and 23 UTF-8 encoded bytes in length, and that
contain only the characters \"0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".]{.mark}

[The Gateway may choose to allow more than 23 bytes.]{.mark}

[The Client Identifier MUST be a UTF-8 Encoded String]{.mark}. []{.mark}

[Table 17: CONNACK Reason Codes values]{.underline}

#### 3.1.5.3 Connack Flags {#connack-flags .unnumbered}

The Connack Flags is 1 byte field located at byte 4 which contains parameters specifying the behavior of the MQTT-SN Virtual Connection on the
gateway.

The Connack *Flags* field includes the following flags:

-   **Session Present:** Stored in Bit 0 and specifies whether an existing session was present on the gateway for the given client identifier

[The Client MUST validate that the reserved flags in the CONNACK packet are set to 0. If any of the reserved flags is not 0 it is a Malformed
Packet.]{.mark}

#### 3.1.5.4 Session Expiry Interval {#session-expiry-interval-1 .unnumbered}

If the Session Expiry Interval is 0, the value of Session Expiry Interval in the CONNECT Packet is used. *The server uses this property to inform the
Client that it is using a value other than that sent by the Client in the CONNECT*.

#### 3.1.5.5 Assigned Client Identifier {#assigned-client-identifier .unnumbered}

The Client Identifier assigned by the gateway when the associated CONNECT packet contained no Client Identifier. [If the Client connects using a zero
length Client Identifier, the Server MUST respond with a CONNACK containing an Assigned Client Identifier. The Assigned Client Identifier MUST be a
new Client Identifier not used by any other Session currently in the Gateway]{.mark}.

[The Assigned Client Identifier MUST be a UTF-8 Encoded String]{.mark}.

> **Informative comment**
>
> Assigned Client Identifiers SHOULD BE be less than 247 bytes so they can be accommodated in a small packet version. This is also to cater for
> devices which may not support larger Client Identifiers.
>
> **Informative comment**
>
> Where a transparent gateway obtains an Assigned Client Identifier which is deemed too large for a device, it should maintain a registry to map
> shorter gateway generated Client Identifiers with their versions returned from the broker.

### 3.1.13 Publish Variants {#publish-variants .unnumbered}

MQTT-SN is designed to be optimized for packet size. For this reason, the PUBLISH packet has been split into 3 variants; Variant 1 catering for
Quality of Service -1 where a protocol version field is required, Variant 2 catering for Quality of Service 0 where no response ACK is required and
thus no packet identifier is required and Quality of Service 1 and 2 where a response is expected, Variant 3 catering for Out Of Band messages where
minimal overhead is required. Due to the fundamental structural difference of QoS -1 and OOB, a respective new packet type has been introduced. The
table below breaks down the different versions of the PUBLISH packet and their respective type identifiers.

[Table 27: PUBLISH packet]{.underline}

This packet is used by both clients and gateways to publish data for a certain topic.

#### 3.1.14.1 Length & Packet Type {#length-packet-type-10 .unnumbered}

The first 2 or 4 bytes of the packet are encoded according to the variable length packet header format. Please refer to section 1.8.2 for a detailed
description.

#### 3.1.14.2 PUBLISH Flags {#publish-flags .unnumbered}

The PUBLISH Flags field is 1-byte located in Byte 3 position of the PUBLISH control packet.

The PUBLISH Flags includes the following flags:

-   **Topic Alias Type**. This is a 2-bit field in Bit 0 and 1 which determines the format of the topic Id value. Refer to [Table
    10](#topic-alias-types) for the definition of the various topic alias types.

-   **QoS**: This is a 2-bit field stored in Bit 5 and 6. QoS has the same meaning as with MQTT indicating the Quality of Service. Set to "0b00" for
    QoS 0, "0b01" for QoS 1, "0b10" for QoS 2, and "0b11" for QoS -1. For a detailed description of the various Quality Of Service levels please refer
    to the operational behavior section.

-   **DUP**: 1 bit field stored in Bit 7 and has the same meaning as with MQTT. It notes the duplicate delivery of packets. If the DUP flag is set to
    "0", it signifies that the packet is sent for the first time. If the DUP flag is set to "1", it signifies that the packet was retransmitted.

-   **Retain**: 1 bit field stored in Bit 4 and has the same meaning as with MQTT. The field signifies whether the existing retained message for this
    topic is replaced or kept.

#### 3.1.14.3 Topic Alias or Topic Length {#topic-alias-or-topic-length .unnumbered}

In the case of Topic Alias Type being b11 this field will refer to the length of data assigned to the "Full Topic Name", in all other cases, this will
be the value used as the topic alias or short topic name.

#### 3.1.14.4 Data {#data .unnumbered}

In the case of Topic Alias Type b11 the data section will be prefixed with a "Full Topic Name" encoded with a UTF-8 encoded string value of length
determined by the previously defined length field. Thereafter,

the *Data* field corresponds to payload of an MQTT PUBLISH packet. It has a variable length and contains the application data that is being published.

[Table 28: PUBLISH packet]{.underline}

This packet is used by both clients and gateways to publish data for a certain topic.

#### 3.1.15.1 Length & Packet Type {#length-packet-type-11 .unnumbered}

The first 2 or 4 bytes of the packet are encoded according to the variable length packet header format. Please refer to section 1.8.2 for a detailed
description.

#### 3.1.15.2 PUBLISH Flags {#publish-flags-1 .unnumbered}

The PUBLISH Flags field is 1-byte located in the Byte 3 position of the PUBLISH control packet.

The PUBLISH Flags includes the following flags:

-   **Topic Alias Type**. This is a 2-bit field in Bit 0 and 1 which determines the format of the topic Id value. Refer to [Table
    10](#topic-alias-types) for the definition of the various topic alias types.

-   **Retain**: 1 bit field stored in Bit 4 and has the same meaning as with MQTT. The field signifies whether the existing retained message for this
    topic is replaced or kept.

#### 3.1.15.3 Topic Alias or Topic Length {#topic-alias-or-topic-length-1 .unnumbered}

In the case of Topic Alias Type being b11 this field will refer to the length of data assigned to the "Full Topic Name", in all other cases, this will
be the value used as the topic alias or short topic name.

#### 3.1.15.4 Data {#data-1 .unnumbered}

In the case of Topic Alias Type b11 the data section will be prefixed with a "Full Topic Name" encoded with a UTF-8 encoded string value of length
determined by the previously defined length field. Thereafter, the *Data* field corresponds to the payload of an MQTT PUBLISH packet. It has a
variable length and contains the application data that is being published.

### 3.1.16 PUBLISH (used for QoS 0) {#publish-used-for-qos-0 .unnumbered}

[Table 29: PUBLISH packet]{.underline}

This packet is used by both clients and gateways to publish data for a certain topic.

#### 3.1.16.1 Length & Packet Type {#length-packet-type-12 .unnumbered}

The first 2 or 4 bytes of the packet are encoded according to the variable length packet header format. Please refer to section 1.8.2 for a detailed
description.

#### 3.1.16.2 PUBLISH Flags {#publish-flags-2 .unnumbered}

The PUBLISH Flags field is 1-byte located in Byte 3 position of the PUBLISH control packet.

The PUBLISH Flags includes the following flags:

-   **Topic Alias Type**. This is a 2-bit field in Bit 0 and 1 which determines the format of the topic Id value. Refer to [Table
    10](#topic-alias-types) for the definition of the various topic alias types.

-   **QoS**: This is a 2-bit field stored in Bit 5 and 6. QoS has the same meaning as with MQTT indicating the Quality of Service. Set to "0b00" for
    QoS 0, "0b01" for QoS 1, "0b10" for QoS 2, and "0b11" for QoS -1. For a detailed description of the various Quality Of Service levels please refer
    to the operational behavior section.

-   **DUP**: 1 bit field stored in Bit 7 and has the same meaning as with MQTT. It notes the duplicate delivery of packet. If the DUP flag is, set to
    "0", it signifies that the packet is sent for the first time. If the DUP flag is set to "1", it signifies that the packet was retransmitted.

-   **Retain**: 1 bit field stored in Bit 4 and has the same meaning as with MQTT. The field signifies whether the existing retained message for this
    topic is replaced or kept.

#### 3.1.16.3 Topic Alias or Topic Length {#topic-alias-or-topic-length-2 .unnumbered}

In the case of Topic Alias Type being b11 this field will refer to the length of data assigned to the "Full Topic Name", in all other cases, this will
be the value used as the topic alias or short topic name.

#### 3.1.16.4 Data {#data-2 .unnumbered}

In the case of Topic Alias Type b11 the data section will be prefixed with a "Full Topic Name" encoded with a UTF-8 encoded string value of length
determined by the previously defined length field. Thereafter, the *Data* field corresponds to the payload of an MQTT PUBLISH packet. It has a
variable length and contains the application data that is being published.

[Table 30: PUBLISH packet]{.underline}

This packet is used by both clients and gateways to publish data for a certain topic.

#### 3.1.17.1 Length & Packet Type {#length-packet-type-13 .unnumbered}

The first 2 or 4 bytes of the packet are encoded according to the variable length packet header format. Please refer to section 1.8.2 for a detailed
description.

#### 3.1.17.2 PUBLISH Flags {#publish-flags-3 .unnumbered}

The PUBLISH Flags field is 1-byte located in Byte 3 position of the PUBLISH control packet.

The PUBLISH Flags includes the following flags:

-   **Topic Alias Type**. This is a 2-bit field in Bit 0 and 1 which determines the format of the topic Id value. Refer to [Table
    10](#topic-alias-types) for the definition of the various topic alias types.

-   **QoS**: This is a 2-bit field stored in Bit 5 and 6. QoS has the same meaning as with MQTT indicating the Quality of Service. Set to "0b00" for
    QoS 0, "0b01" for QoS 1, "0b10" for QoS 2, and "0b11" for QoS -1. For a detailed description of the various Quality Of Service levels please refer
    to the operational behavior section.

-   **DUP**: 1 bit field stored in Bit 7 and has the same meaning as with MQTT. It notes the duplicate delivery of packets. If the DUP flag is set to
    "0", it signifies that the packet is sent for the first time. If the DUP flag is set to "1", it signifies that the packet was retransmitted.

-   **Retain**: 1 bit field stored in Bit 4 and has the same meaning as with MQTT. The field signifies whether the existing retained message for this
    topic is replaced or kept.

#### 3.1.17.3 Topic Length {#topic-length .unnumbered}

Contains the length of the topic value. This will be either 2 bytes when using a standard alias (0b00, 0b01 or 0b10) or the length of the full topic
name when the topic type is 0b11.

#### 3.1.17.4 Packet Id {#packet-id-2 .unnumbered}

Same meaning as the MQTT "Packet ID"; only relevant in case of QoS levels 1 and 2, otherwise coded 0x0000.

#### 3.1.17.5 Topic Alias or Topic Name {#topic-alias-or-topic-name .unnumbered}

Contains topic name encoded as a Fixed Length UTF-8 Encoded String, topic alias, or short topic name as indicated in the *Topic Alias Type* field in
flags.

#### 3.1.17.6 Data {#data-3 .unnumbered}

The *Data* field corresponds to the payload of an MQTT PUBLISH packet. It has a variable length and contains the application data that is being
published.

[Table 36: SUBSCRIBE packet]{.underline}

The SUBSCRIBE packet is used by a client to subscribe to a certain topic name.

#### 3.1.22.1 Length & Packet Type {#length-packet-type-18 .unnumbered}

The first 2 or 4 bytes of the packet are encoded according to the variable length packet header format. Please refer to section 1.8.2 for a detailed
description.

#### 3.1.22.2 SUBSCRIBE Flags {#subscribe-flags .unnumbered}

The SUBSCRIBE Flags field is 1-byte and contains the following flags:

-   **QoS**: maximum QoS. This gives the maximum QoS level at which the Server can send Application Messages to the Client. It is a Protocol Error if
    the Maximum QoS field has the value 3.

-   **No Local**: if the value is 1, Application Messages MUST NOT be forwarded to a Virtual Connection with a ClientID equal to the ClientID of the
    publishing Virtual Connection

-   **Retain as published**: If 1, Application Messages forwarded using this subscription keep the RETAIN flag they were published with. If 0,
    Application Messages forwarded using this subscription have the RETAIN flag set to 0. Retained messages sent when the subscription is established
    have the RETAIN flag set to 1.

-   **Retain handling**: This option specifies whether retained messages are sent when the subscription is established. This does not affect the
    sending of retained messages at any point after the subscribe. If there are no retained messages matching the Topic Filter, all these values act
    the same. The values are:

    -   0: Send retained messages at the time of the subscribe

    -   1: Send retained messages at subscribe only if the subscription does not currently exist

    -   2: Do not send retained messages at the time of the subscribe.

> It is a Protocol Error to send a Retain Handling value of 3.

-   **Topic Alias Type**: indicates the type of Topic Alias or Topic Filter included in this packet. Refer to [Table 10](#topic-alias-types) for the
    definition of the various types.

#### 3.1.22.3 Packet Id {#packet-id-6 .unnumbered}

Should be coded such that it can be used to identify the corresponding SUBACK packet.

#### 3.1.22.4 Topic Alias or Topic Filter {#topic-alias-or-topic-filter .unnumbered}

Contains Fixed Length UTF-8 Encoded String topic filter, topic alias, or short topic name as indicated in the *Topic Alias Type* field in flags.
Determines the topic names which this subscription is interested in.

[Table 43: PINGRESP packet]{.underline}

As with MQTT, a PINGRESP packet is the response to a PINGREQ packet and means "yes I am alive". Keep Alive packets flow in either direction, sent
either by a connected client or the gateway. it has only a header and no variable part.

Moreover, a PINGRESP packet is sent by a gateway to inform a sleeping client that it has no more buffered packets for that client.

#### 3.1.27.1 Length & Packet Type {#length-packet-type-23 .unnumbered}

The first 2 or 4 bytes of the packet are encoded according to the variable length packet header format. Please refer to section 1.8.2 for a detailed
description.

#### 3.1.27.2 Messages Remaining {#messages-remaining .unnumbered}

The number of messages left when a client is sent back to sleep. Optional -- for use at the end of a client\'s awake period. Values can be:

[Table 45: DISCONNECT packet]{.underline}

As with MQTT, the DISCONNECT packet is sent by a client to indicate that it wants to close the Virtual connection. The gateway will acknowledge the
receipt of that packet by returning a DISCONNECT to the client. A server or gateway may also send a DISCONNECT to a client, e.g. in case a gateway,
due to an error, cannot map a received packet to a client. Upon receiving such a DISCONNECT packet, a client should try to setup the Virtual
Connection again by sending a CONNECT packet to the gateway or server.

A DISCONNECT packet with a *Session Expiry Interval* field is sent by a client when it wants to go to the "asleep" state. The receipt of this packet
is also acknowledged by the gateway by means of a DISCONNECT packet.

#### 3.1.28.1 Length & Packet Type {#length-packet-type-24 .unnumbered}

The first 2 or 4 bytes of the packet are encoded according to the variable length packet header format. Please refer to section 1.8.2 for a detailed
description.

#### 3.1.28.2 Disconnect Flags {#disconnect-flags .unnumbered}

The Disconnect Flags is 1 byte field located at byte 3 which contains parameters specifying the behavior of the MQTT-SN sleep on the gateway.

The Disconnect *Flags* field includes the following flags:

-   **Reason Code Present:** Stored in Bit 3 Does the reason code exist on the packet

-   **Session Expiry Interval Present:** Stored in Bit 2, Does the session expiry interval field exist.

-   **Reason String Present:** Stored in Bit 1, Does the reason string field exist

-   **Retain Registrations:** Stored in Bit 0 and specifies whether registrations should be retained by the gateway during the sleep state. "0"
    indicates registrations should be removed during the sleeping period and renegotiated when AWAKE or ACTIVE. "1" indicates registrations should be
    retained during the SLEEP period, and therefore not renegotiated when AWAKE or ACTIVE.

[The Gateway MUST validate that the reserved flags in the DISCONNECT packet are set to 0. If any of the reserved flags is not 0 it is a Malformed
Packet.]{.mark}

#### 3.1.28.3 Reason Code {#reason-code-7 .unnumbered}

The Reason Code for the DISCONNECT control packet is optional. If provided, Byte 3 in the DISCONNECT control packet holds the Reason Code of the
disconnection.

#### 3.1.28.4 Session Expiry Interval {#session-expiry-interval-2 .unnumbered}

The Session Expiry Interval is a four-byte integer time interval measured in seconds. If the Session Expiry Interval is set to 0 or omitted, the
Session is transitioned to the "***disconnected***" state. When the value of this field is greater than zero, it is deemed to be sent by a client that
wants to transition to the "***asleep***" state, see Section 3.19 for further details. At this point the keep alive timer becomes obsolete until the
device issues a new CONNECT.

[Table 53: Format of an encapsulated MQTT-SN frame]{.underline}

As detailed in Section 4, MQTT-SN clients can also access a GW via a forwarder in case the GW is not directly attached to their WSNs. The forwarder
simply encapsulates the MQTT-SN frames it receives on the wireless side and forwards them unchanged to the GW; in the opposite direction, it
decapsulates the frames it receives from the gateway and sends them to the clients, unchanged too.

[Table 53: Format of the protection packet]{.underline}

The PROTECTION packet provides a secure envelope for any other MQTT-SN packet (with the exception of the Forward Encapsulation packet). The fields
provided on the protection packet provide a means by which the sender can be identified and the packet can be protected, using a number of prescribed
protection schemes.

The sender is the originator of the "Protected MQTT-SN Packet" and responsible for its protection. This responsibility can't be delegated to a third
entity like a Forwarder.

The sender identification is required as the sender and the receiver of the PROTECTION packet must have access to the same shared key to be used
directly or after derivation. The authentication of the sender and the receiver, their authorizations and the provisioning of the shared keys used to
protect integrity and optionally confidentiality of the PROTECTION packet content are out of scope for this technical proposal.

A PROTECTION packet, like any other one, can be the payload of a Forward Encapsulation packet.

**//TODO - Break out the conformance aspects of this paragraph from recommendations.**

[When the PROTECTION packet is handled by a GW, it is mandatory to use it to protect all MQTT-SN packets exchanged with a Client for which a shared
key (indexed by its Sender Id) is available.]{.mark}

[If the client is not enrolled to the GW (so the GW has no access to a key shared with it on the basis of its Sender Id) and the Client and GW are not
in a private network, it is recommended for the GW to process only MQTT-SN packets received over a DTLS session initiated with mutual authentication
by the client.]{.mark}

#### 3.1.34.1 Length {#length-2 .unnumbered}

The first 2 or 4 bytes of the packet are encoded according to the variable length packet header format. Please refer to section 1.8.2 for a detailed
description.

#### 3.1.34.2 Packet Type {#packet-type-1 .unnumbered}

Coded "0x1E", see Table 63

#### 3.1.34.3 Protection Flags {#protection-flags .unnumbered}

The PROTECTION Flags is 1 byte field in Byte position 3 of the packet, specifying the properties of the PROTECTION.

The PROTECTION Flags field includes the following flags:

-   **(Auth)entication tag length -** (4 bits) should represent the number of 16 bits groups forming the authentication tag in big-endian order.

    -   Only 14 of the 16 possible values are allowed:

        -   If 0x00, the authentication tag length is provider defined

        -   the values from 0x1 to 0x2 are Reserved;

        -   any other value 0xZ, so between 0x3 and 0xF, is allowed and the authentication tag length will be (0xZ+1)\*16 bits; for example

            -   if the value is 0xF, the Authentication tag length will be (0xF+1)\*16=256 bits;

            -   if the value is 0x3, the Authentication tag length will be (0x3+1)\*16=64 bits;

    -   If a truncation of the output of the authentication algorithm is required, it has to be taken in most significant bits first order (leftmost
        bits).

    -   If an extension of the output of the authentication algorithm is required, 0s are appended until the Authentication tag length is reached.

    -   Some values are not allowed for some protection schemes. For instance the values 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06 are not allowed for AES-CCM-128-128,
        AES-CCM-128-192, AES-CCM-128-256, AES-GCM-128-128, AES-GCM-128-192, AES-GCM-128-256 and ChaCha20/Poly1305 as for those protection schemes the
        128-bit authentication tag can't be truncated.

<!-- -->

-   **Crypto material length -** (2 bits) should represent the number of 16 bits groups forming the crypto material in big-endian order. Below the
    meaning of each possible value:

    -   if 0x3, a crypto material field of 96 bits (12 bytes) is present

    -   if 0x2, a crypto material field of 32 bits (4 bytes) is present

    -   if 0x1, a crypto material field of 16 bits (2 bytes) is present

    -   if 0x0, the crypto material field is not present.

<!-- -->

-   **Monotonic counter length -** (2 bits) should represent the number of bytes forming the monotonic counter in big-endian order. Only 3 of the 4
    possible values are allowed:

    -   the value 0x3 is Reserved;

    -   if 0x2, a monotonic counter field of 32 bits (4 bytes) is present;

    -   if 0x1, a monotonic counter field of 16 bits (2 bytes) is present;

    -   if 0x0, the monotonic counter field is not present.

#### 3.1.34.4 Protection Scheme {#protection-scheme .unnumbered}

> A (1 byte) field located at byte 4 should contain one of the not Reserved indexes in the following table. In general two types of protection scheme
> are considered: **Authentication only** (like HMAC or CMAC) and **AEAD** (Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data, like GCM, CCM or
> ChaCha20/Poly1305).

#### 3.1.34.5 Sender Id {#sender-id .unnumbered}

Located at Bytes 5 - 12 the Sender Id field (8 bytes) should contain:

If the message is originated by the ***Gateway***:

-   The SHA256 of the GwId truncated to the leftmost 64 bits (8 bytes);

> If the message is originated by the ***Client***:

-   **If a session is available**: the SHA256 of the \[Client Identifier\] truncated to the leftmost 64 bits (8 bytes);

-   **If a session is not available**: a unique value per sender over 8 bytes (like a MAC address, or other identifying characteristics). The methods
    to guarantee the uniqueness of the Sender Id in this case are out of scope for this technical proposal.

#### 3.1.34.6 Random {#random .unnumbered}

**[Located at Byte 13 - 16]{.underline}** , the "**Random**" field (4 bytes) should contain a random number (not guessable) generated at the
PROTECTION packet creation .

#### 3.1.34.7 Crypto Material {#crypto-material .unnumbered}

Located at Byte (17 - P), the optional field "**Crypto Material**" contains [0, 2, 4 or 12 bytes of crypto material that when defined it can be used
to derive, from a shared master secret, the same keys on the two endpoints and/or, when filled partially or totally with a random value, to further
reduce the probability of IV/nonce reuse for CCM or GCM or ChaCha20/Poly1305. For instance when the Crypto material length is set to 0x03, the Crypto
Material field can be partially filled with a random value of 9 bytes (the remaining 3 bytes can be set to 0 if not used) in order to reach the 13
bytes used only once recommended for the nonce used by CCM or it can be partially filled with a random value of 8 bytes in order to reach the 12 bytes
used only once recommended for the IV/nonce used by GCM or ChaCha20/Poly1305 .]{.mark}

#### 3.1.34.8 Monotonic Counter {#monotonic-counter .unnumbered}

Located at Byte Byte (Q - R), the optional field "**Monotonic Counter**" contains [0, 2 or 4 byte number that when defined, is increased by the Client
or GW for every packet sent. The counters should be considered independent of session or destination. E.g. The UE will keep a counter independently
from the GW.]{.mark}

#### 3.1.34.9 Protected MQTT-SN Packet {#protected-mqtt-sn-packet .unnumbered}

Located at Byte (S - T), the field "**Protected MQTT-SN Packet**" contains the MQTT-SN packet that is being secured, encoded as per its packet type.

The "Protected MQTT-SN Packet" should not be a "Forwarder-Encapsulation packet" as the shared key used directly or after derivation for the protection
must belong to the originator of the content and not to a Forwarder that, in general, is not able to securely identify the originator.

#### 3.1.34.10 Authentication Tag {#authentication-tag .unnumbered}

Located at Byte (U - N), the field "**Authentication tag**" field has a length depending on the "Authentication tag length" flag and it is calculated,
on the basis of the "Protection scheme" selected in Byte 4, on ALL the preceding fields.

# 4 Operational behavior {#operational-behavior .unnumbered}

An important design point of MQTT-SN is to be as close as possible to MQTT. Therefore, all protocol semantics should remain, as far as possible, the
same as those defined by MQTT. In the following we will focus on those points that either are new to or deviate from MQTT.

## 4.1 MQTT-SN Architecture {#mqtt-sn-architecture .unnumbered}

> ![Diagram Description automatically generated](media/image8.png){width="6.5in" height="6.580555555555556in"}

Figure 1: MQTT-SN Architecture

The architecture of MQTT-SN is shown in figure 1. There are three kinds of MQTT-SN components, MQTT-SN *clients*, MQTT-SN *gateways*, and MQTT-SN
*forwarders*. MQTT-SN clients connect themselves to an MQTT server/broker via an MQTT-SN Gateway using the MQTT-SN protocol. An MQTT-SN Gateway may or
may not be integrated with a MQTT server. Where an MQTT broker is involved, the MQTT protocol is used between the MQTT broker and the MQTT-SN Gateway.
Its main function is the translation between MQTT and MQTT-SN.

MQTT-SN clients can also access a Gateway via a forwarder in case the Gateway is not directly attached to their network. The forwarder simply
encapsulates the MQTT-SN frames it receives on the wireless side and forwards them unchanged to the Gateway; in the opposite direction, it
decapsulates the frames it receives from the gateway and sends them to the clients, unchanged too.

We can differentiate between three types of MQTT-SN server-side endpoint, namely transparent Gateway, aggregating Gateway and Terminating Gateway, see
Fig. 1. They are explained in the following sections..

### 4.1.1 Transparent Gateway {#transparent-gateway .unnumbered}

For each connected MQTT-SN client a transparent Gateway will set up and maintain a MQTT connection to the MQTT server. This MQTT connection is
reserved exclusively for the end-to-end and almost transparent packet exchange between the client and the server. There will be as many MQTT
connections between the Gateway and the server as MQTT-SN clients connected to the Gateway. The transparent Gateway will perform a "syntax"
translation between the two protocols. Since all packet exchanges are end-to-end between the MQTT-SN client and the MQTT Server, all functions and
features that are implemented by the server can be offered to the client.

Although the implementation of the transparent Gateway is simpler when compared to the one of an aggregating Gateway, it requires the MQTT server to
support a separate connection for each active client. Some MQTT server implementations might impose a limitation on the number of concurrent
connections that they support.

Figure 2: Transparent and Aggregating Gateways

### 4.1.2 Aggregating Gateway {#aggregating-gateway .unnumbered}

Instead of having a MQTT connection for each connected client, an aggregating Gateway will have only one MQTT connection to the Server. All packet
exchanges between a MQTT-SN client and an aggregating Gateway end at the Gateway. The Gateway then decides which information will be given further to
the Server. Although its implementation is more complex than the one of a transparent Gateway, an aggregating Gateway may be helpful in case of WSNs
with very large number of SAs because it reduces the number of MQTT connections that the Gateway must support concurrently.

### 4.1.3 Terminating Gateway {#terminating-gateway .unnumbered}

The Terminating Gateway is the consumer of the data sent by the MQTT-SN Client and, if the PROTECTION packet is used, it is responsible for the
enrollment of the MQTT-SN Clients.

## 4.2 Networks & Transport Layers {#networks-transport-layers .unnumbered}

The MQTT-SN V2.0 protocol requires an underlying transport to create a Virtual Connection, this carries datagrams from a Client to a Gateway and a
Gateway to a Client.\
The underlying transport may also multicastdatagrams from a Client to all Gateways and from a Gateway to all Clients.\
The datagrams carry the MQTT-SN V2.0 Packets which must be received unaltered and complete.

-   The underlying transport does not need to be reliable, it is expected that datagrams will be lost or delivered out of order.

-   If the network might deliver a datagram more than once, then it is highly recommended that the PROTECTION packet Monotonic Counter is used to
    eliminate the duplicates.

-   The MQTT-SN V2.0 protocol will tolerate out of order Packets and it will retransmit lost Packets.

-   The MQTT-SN V2.0 does not perform error correction. If a corrupted or partial Packets is received it will cause a protocol error.

-   The MQTT-SN V2.0 implementation may use either the origin network address or the sender identifier in the PROTECTION Packet to determine the
    identity of the Virtual Connection.

-   The underlying network does not need to provide low latency transmission.

-   The networks may be connectionless, the Virtual Connections do not need to have an event that signals when they begin or end.

-   The networks may be radio networks.

**Informative comment**

UDP as defined in \[RFC0768\] can be used for MQTT-SN v2.0 if the Maximum Transmission Unit is configured to be more than the MQTT-SN Packet size used
and no datagram fragmentation occurs.\
Depending on the network configuration, UDP can duplicate datagrams. If this can happen, the PROTECTION Packet monotonic counter should be used.

Examples of possible consequences of not removing duplicates datagrams are:\
-- DISCONNECT Packet applied to the wrong Virtual Connection\
-- SUBSCRIBE and UNSUBSCRIBE Packets applied to the wrong Virtual Connection\
-- PUBLISH QOS=2 published more than once

The following transport protocols are also suitable but if not capable of multicast the implementation of the optional ADVERTISE, SEARCHGW, GWINFO
packets may not be possible and also the multicast of the PUBLISH MINUS -1 packets may not be possible:

-   DTLS v1.2 \[RFC6347\]

-   DTLS v1.3 \[RFC9147\]

-   QUIC \[RFC9000\]

-   Non-IP protocolsTCP/IP \[RFC0793\]

-   TLS \[RFC5246\]

-   WebSocket \[RFC6455\].

**Informative comment**

TCP ports 8883 and 1883 are registered with IANA for MQTT TLS and non-TLS communication respectively.

## 4.3 Gateway Advertisement and Discovery {#gateway-advertisement-and-discovery .unnumbered}

A gateway may announce its presence by transmitting periodically an ADVERTISE packet to all devices that are currently parts of the network. A gateway
should only advertise its presence if it is connected to a server (or is itself a server).

Multiple gateways may be active at the same time in the same network. In this case they will have different ids. It is up to the client to decide to
which gateway it wants to connect. [At any point in time a client is allowed to be connected to only one gateway.]{.mark}

A client should maintain a list of active gateways together with their network addresses. This list is populated by means of the ADVERTISE and GWINFO
packets received.

The time duration *T~ADV\ ~*until the gateway sends the next ADVERTISE packet is indicated in the *Duration* field of the ADVERTISE packets. A client
may use this information to monitor the availability of a gateway. For example, if it does not receive ADVERTISE packets from a gateway for
*N~ADV\ ~*consecutive times, it may assume that the gateway is down and removes it from its list of active gateways. Similarly, gateways in stand-by
mode will become active (i.e. start sending ADVERTISE packets) if they miss successively a couple of times advertisements from a certain gateway.

Since the ADVERTISE packets are transmitted into the whole wireless network, the time interval *T~ADV\ ~*between two ADVERTISE packets sent by a
gateway should be large enough (e.g. greater than 15 min) to avoid bandwidth congestion in the network.

The large value of *T~ADV\ ~*will lead to a long waiting time for new clients which are looking for a gateway. To shorten this waiting time a client
may send a SEARCHGW packet. To prevent network flooding when multiple clients start searching for GW almost at the same time, the sending of the
SEARCHGW packet is delayed by a random time between 0 and *T~SEARCHGW~*. A client will cancel its transmission of the SEARCHGW packet if it receives
during this delay time a SEARCHGW packet sent by another client and identical to the one it wants to send, and behaves as if the SEARCHGW packet was
sent by itself.

The transmission radius *R~b\ ~*of the SEARCHGW packet is limited, e.g. to a single hop in case of a dense deployment of MQTT-SN clients.

Upon receiving a SEARCHGW packet a gateway replies with a GWINFO packet containing its id. Similarly, a client answers with a GWINFO packet if it has
at least one active gateway in its list of active gateways. If the client has multiple GWs in its list, it selects one GW out of its list and includes
that information into the GWINFO packet.

Like the SEARCHGW packet, the GWINFO packet is transmitted with the same radius *R~b~*, which is indicated in the SEARCHGW packet. The radius
*R~b\ ~*is also given to the underlying layer when these two packets are passed down for transmission.

To give priority to the gateways a client will delay its sending of the GWINFO packet for a random time

*T~GWINFO~*. If during this delay time the client receives a GWINFO packet it will cancel the transmission of its GWINFO packet.

In case of no response the SEARCHGW packet may be retransmitted. In this case the time intervals between consecutive SEARCHGW packets should be
increased by the exponential backoff algorithm described in the appendix.

## 4.4 Session Establishment {#session-establishment .unnumbered}

As with MQTT, an MQTT-SN client needs to set up a session on the GW, unless it is publishing ONLY using OUT OF BAND packets. The procedure for setting
up a session with a GW is illustrated in Fig. 3.

The CONNECT packet contains flags to communicate to the gateway that will or auth or both interactions should take place.

![A picture containing shape Description automatically generated](media/image2.png){width="2.4305555555555554in" height="1.5in"}

Figure 3a: Connect procedure (without will flag set)

If the Will flag is set, the client then sends these two pieces of information to the GW upon receiving the corresponding request packets WILLTOPICREQ
and WILLMSQREQ. The procedure is terminated with the CONNACK packet sent by the GW.

> ![A picture containing graphical user interface Description automatically generated](media/image3.png){width="3.361111111111111in"

height="2.7222222222222223in"}

Figure 3c: Connect procedure (with auth flag set)

In case the gateway could not accept the CONNECT request (e.g. because of congestion or it does not support a feature indicated in the CONNECT
packet), the gateway returns a CONNACK packet with the rejection reason.

In the case where the client provides no client identifier, the Server MUST respond with a CONNACK containing an Assigned Client Identifier.

[The Assigned Client Identifier MUST be a new Client Identifier not used by any other Session currently in the gateway.]{.mark}

## 4.5 Quality of Service levels and protocol flows {#quality-of-service-levels-and-protocol-flows .unnumbered}

MQTT delivers Application Messages according to the Quality of Service (QoS) levels defined in the following sections. The delivery protocol is
symmetric, in the description below the Client and Server & Gateway can each take the role of either sender or receiver. The delivery protocol is
concerned solely with the delivery of an application message from a single sender to a single receiver. When the Gateway is delivering an Application
Message to more than one Client, each Client is treated independently. The QoS level used to deliver an Application Message outbound to the Client
could differ from that of the inbound Application Message.

### 4.5.1 QoS 0: At most once delivery {#qos-0-at-most-once-delivery .unnumbered}

The message is delivered according to the capabilities of the underlying network. No response is sent by the receiver and no retry is performed by the
sender. The message arrives at the receiver either once or not at all.

[In the QoS 0 delivery protocol, the sender]{.mark}

-   [MUST send a PUBLISH packet with QoS 0 and DUP flag set to 0]{.mark}.

In the QoS 0 delivery protocol, the receiver

-   Accepts ownership of the message when it receives the PUBLISH packet.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.5.2 QoS 1: At least once delivery {#qos-1-at-least-once-delivery .unnumbered}

This Quality of Service level ensures that the message arrives at the receiver at least once. A QoS 1 PUBLISH packet has a Packet Identifier in its
Variable Header and is acknowledged by a PUBACK packet.

[In the QoS 1 delivery protocol, the sender]{.mark}

-   [MUST assign an unused Packet Identifier each time it has a new Application Message to publish]{.mark}

-   [MUST send a PUBLISH packet containing this Packet Identifier with QoS 1 and DUP flag set to 0]{.mark}

-   [MUST treat the PUBLISH packet as "unacknowledged" until it has received the corresponding PUBACK packet from the receiver]{.mark}.

The Packet Identifier becomes available for reuse once the sender has received the PUBACK packet.

**[In a difference to MQTT 5, the sender is NOT permitted to send further PUBLISH packets with different Packet Identifiers while it is waiting to
receive acknowledgements. At any given time a sender]{.mark}** **[must ONLY have 1 outstanding application message inflight.]{.mark}**

[In the QoS 1 delivery protocol, the receiver]{.mark}

-   [MUST respond with a PUBACK packet containing the Packet Identifier from the incoming PUBLISH packet, having accepted ownership of the Application
    Message]{.mark}

-   [After it has sent a PUBACK packet the receiver MUST treat any incoming PUBLISH packet that contains the same Packet Identifier as being a new
    Application Message, irrespective of the setting of its DUP flag]{.mark}

### 4.5.3 QoS 2: Exactly once delivery {#qos-2-exactly-once-delivery .unnumbered}

This is the highest Quality of Service level, for use when neither loss nor duplication of messages are acceptable. There is an increased overhead
associated with QoS 2.

[In the QoS 2 delivery protocol, the sender]{.mark}:

-   [MUST assign an unused Packet Identifier when it has a new Application Message to publish]{.mark}

-   [MUST send a PUBLISH packet containing this Packet Identifier with QoS 2 and DUP flag set to 0]{.mark}

-   [MUST treat the PUBLISH packet as "unacknowledged" until it has received the corresponding PUBREC packet from the receiver]{.mark}

-   [MUST send a PUBREL packet when it receives a PUBREC packet from the receiver with a Reason Code value less than 0x80. This PUBREL packet MUST
    contain the same Packet Identifier as the original PUBLISH packet]{.mark}

-   [MUST treat the PUBREL packet as "unacknowledged" until it has received the corresponding PUBCOMP packet from the receiver]{.mark}

-   [MUST NOT re-send the PUBLISH once it has sent the corresponding PUBREL packe]{.mark}t

-   [MUST NOT apply Message expiry if a PUBLISH packet has been sent]{.mark}

The Packet Identifier becomes available for reuse once the sender has received the PUBCOMP packet or a PUBREC with a Reason Code of 0x80 or greater.

**[In a difference to MQTT 5, the sender is NOT permitted to send further PUBLISH packets with different Packet Identifiers while it is waiting to
receive acknowledgements. At any given time a sender my ONLY have 1 outstanding application message inflight.]{.mark}**

[In the QoS 2 delivery protocol, the receiver]{.mark}:

-   [MUST respond with a PUBREC containing the Packet Identifier from the incoming PUBLISH packet, having accepted ownership of the Application
    Message]{.mark}

-   [If it has sent a PUBREC with a Reason Code of 0x80 or greater, the receiver MUST treat any subsequent PUBLISH packet that contains that Packet
    Identifier as being a new Application Message]{.mark}

-   [Until it has received the corresponding PUBREL packet, the receiver MUST acknowledge any subsequent PUBLISH packet with the same Packet
    Identifier by sending a PUBREC. It MUST NOT cause duplicate messages to be delivered to any onward recipients in this case]{.mark}

-   [MUST respond to a PUBREL packet by sending a PUBCOMP packet containing the same Packet Identifier as the PUBREL]{.mark}

-   [After it has sent a PUBCOMP, the receiver MUST treat any subsequent PUBLISH packet that contains that Packet Identifier as being a new
    Application Message]{.mark}

### 4.5.4 QoS -1: Constrained client delivery {#qos--1-constrained-client-delivery .unnumbered}

This feature is defined for very simple client implementations which only support a limited sub-set of features. There is no requirement to setup nor
tear down a Virtual Connection, no registration nor subscription. The sender just sends its PUBLISH packets to it's counterpart (whose address is
known a-priori) and forgets them. It does not care whether the address is correct, whether the counterpart is alive, or whether the packets arrive.
Only the following parameter values are allowed for a PUBLISH packet with QoS level -1:

-   QoS flag: set to "0b11"

-   Topic Alias Type flag: either "0b01" for pre-defined topic alias, "0b10" for short topic name, "0b11" for full topic names.

-   Topic Alias or Topic Name field: value of the pre-defined topic alias or of the short topic or of the full topic name

-   Data field: the data to be published.

Whilst no Virtual Connection is mandated for QoS -1 delivery, a constrained client who has previously connected and established a session may wish to
PUBLISH at QoS -1 during any of the lifecycle states. If the GW can determine the origin of a QoS -1 packet, it should not impact/change any existing
session except for resetting the keep-alive timer.

### 4.5.5 OUT OF BAND: Constrained client delivery {#out-of-band-constrained-client-delivery .unnumbered}

This feature is defined for very simple client implementations which only support a limited sub-set of features. There is no requirement to setup nor
tear down a Virtual Connection, no registration nor subscription. The sender just sends its PUBLISH packets to it's counterpart (whose address is
known a-priori) and forgets them. It does not care whether the address is correct, whether the counterpart is alive, or whether the packets arrive.
Only the following parameter values are allowed for a PUBLISH OUT OF BAND packet:

-   Topic Alias Type flag: either "0b01" for pre-defined topic alias, "0b10" for short topic name, "0b11" for full topic names.

-   Topic Alias or Topic Name field: value of the pre-defined topic alias or of the short topic or of the full topic name

-   Data field: the data to be published.

Whilst no Virtual Connection is mandated for OUT OF BAND delivery, a constrained client who has previously connected and established a session may
wish to PUBLISH OUT OF BAND during any of the lifecycle states. If the GW can determine the origin of a OUT OF BAND packet, it should not
impact/change any existing session except for resetting the keep-alive timer.

## 4.6 Client states {#client-states .unnumbered}

At any given point in time, a client may be in one of **5 different states**. Transition through these states is governed by a strictly coordinated
sequence of packets between client and server/gateway and further mediated by timers resident on the gateway. A client is in the *active* state when
the server/gateway receives a CONNECT packet from that client. This state is supervised by the server/gateway with the "keep alive" timer. If the
server/gateway does not receive any packet from the client for a period longer than the keep alive duration (indicated in the CONNECT packet), the
gateway will consider that client as *lost* and activates for example the Will feature for that client. A client goes to the *disconnected* state when
the server/gateway receives a DISCONNECT without a *session expiry interval* field. This state is not time-supervised by the server/gateway. A client
moves into the asleep state by issuing a DISCONNECT with a *session expiry interval* field. For more information on the sleep state, please refer to
the "Sleeping clients" section.

## 4.7 Session state {#session-state .unnumbered}

Sessions are maintained by both the Client and a Gateway. Sessions typically include (but are not limited to):

-   Client Identifier

-   Last packet received timestamp

-   Keep Alive value

-   Session Expiry Interval value

-   Outbound unconfirmed application messages

-   Inbound unconfirmed application messages

-   Buffered messages from the broker

-   Registered topic alias dictionary (normal topic alias's)

-   Confirmed subscriptions with their granted QoS

-   Network address of Gateway (in the case of clients).

-   Network address of Client (in the case of gateways).

-   Next outbound packet identifier

## 4.8 Clean start {#clean-start .unnumbered}

With MQTT-SN, when a client disconnects, its subscriptions are retained for no more than the session expiration time. They are persistent and valid
for new Virtual Connections, until either they are explicitly un-subscribed by the client, or the client establishes a new Virtual Connection with the
"clean start" flag set or their idle time exceeds the session expiry interval associated with the session.

In MQTT-SN the meaning of a "clean start" is extended to the Will feature, i.e. not only the subscriptions are persistent, but also the Will topic and
the Will packet. The two flags "CleanStart" and "Will" in the CONNECT have then the following meanings:

-   CleanStart=true, Will=true: The GW will delete all subscriptions and Will data related to the client, and starts prompting for new Will topic and
    Will packet.

-   CleanStart=true, Will=false: The GW will delete all subscriptions and Will data related to the client, and returns CONNACK (no prompting for Will
    topic and Will packet).

-   CleanStart=false, Will=true: The GW keeps all stored client's data, but prompts for new Will topic and Will packet. The newly received Will data
    will overwrite the stored Will data.

-   CleanStart=false, Will=false: The GW keeps all stored client's data and returns CONNACK (no prompting for Will topic and Will packet).

Note that if a client wants to delete only its Will data at Virtual Connection setup, it could send a CONNECT packet with "CleanStart=false" and
"Will=true", and sends an empty WILLTOPIC packet to the GW when prompted to do so. It could also send a CONNECT packet with "CleanStart=false" and
"Will=false" and use the will update PACKETS to modify the Will data.

## 4.9 Procedure for updating the Will data {#procedure-for-updating-the-will-data .unnumbered}

At any time during a Virtual Connection a client could update its Will data stored in the gateway by sending a WILLTOPICUPD or a WILLMSGUPD packet.
The information contained in these two packets will overwrite the corresponding ones stored in the gateway. Both packets are acknowledged by the
gateway. Both packets can be used independently from each other.

Note that an empty WILLTOPICUPD packet will delete both the Will topic and Will packet stored at the gateway.

## 4.10 Topic Name and Topic Filter Registration Procedure {#topic-name-and-topic-filter-registration-procedure .unnumbered}

Because of the limited bandwidth and the small packet payload in wireless sensor networks, data is not published together with its topic name as in
MQTT. A registration procedure is introduced which allows both a client and a GW to inform its peer about the short topic alias and its corresponding
topic name before it can start sending PUBLISH packets using the short topic alias.

A topic alias is a two-byte long replacement of the string-based topic name. A client needs to use the REGISTER procedure to inform the gateway about
the topic name it wants to employ and gets from the gateway the corresponding topic alias. It then will use this topic alias in the PUBLISH packets it
sends to the gateway. In the opposite direction, the PUBLISH packets also contain a 2-byte topic alias (instead of the string-based topic name). The
client is informed about the relation between topic alias and topic name by means of either a former SUBSCRIBE procedure, or a REGISTER procedure
started by the gateway.

To register a topic name a client sends a REGISTER packet to the GW. If the registration could be accepted, the gateway assigns a *topic alias* to the
received topic name and returns it with a REGACK packet to the client.

If the client initiates a REGISTER against a topic which is known by the gateway to have a predefined topic alias associated with it, it is an error
case, but one which should not be terminal to the session since firmware updates could lead to this scenario. The gateway will specify its topic alias
type to be predefined and set the topic alias value to match that defined on the gateway in the REGACK, it will also set an ERROR reason code on the
REGACK to indicate the issue. The client can then choose to update its registry of predefined topic alias' if it so wishes.

[Predefined topicId values CANNOT be used interchangeably with the NORMAL alias type. This is considered a protocol violation.]{.mark}

If there are no predefined topic alias', the gateway will pass back a NORMAL topic alias type. If the registration could not be accepted, a REGACK is
also returned to the client with the failure reason encoded in the *ReasonCode* field.

After having received the REGACK packet with *ReasonCode ="accepted"*, the client shall use the assigned *topicId* to publish data of the
corresponding topic name. If, however the REGACK contains a rejection code, the client may try to register later again. If the Reason Code was
*"Congestion"*, the client should wait for a time *T~WAIT\ ~*before restarting the registration procedure.

At any point in time a client may have only one REGISTER packet outstanding, i.e., it must wait for a REGACK packet before it can register another
topic name.

A GW sends a REGISTER packet to a client if it wants to inform that client about the topic name and the assigned topic alias that it will use later
when sending PUBLISH packets of the corresponding topic name. This happens for example when no prior registrations exists, or when the client has
DISCONNECTED with retail registration false, or the client re-connects without having set the "CleanStart" flag or the client has subscribed to topic
names that contain wildcard characters such as \# or +.

> **Informative comment**
>
> The gateway should attempt to make the best effort to reuse the same topic alias' mappings that existed during any initial associated ACTIVE states.

## 4.11 Topic Name and Topic Filter Mapping and Aliasing {#topic-name-and-topic-filter-mapping-and-aliasing .unnumbered}

[On the gateway the mapping table between registered topic ids and topic names MUST be implemented per client (and not by a single shared pool between
all clients), to reduce the risk of an incorrect topic id from a client matching another client's valid topic.]{.mark}

For performance and efficiency reasons the broker may choose to align topic alias' for registered normal topic aliases between multiple clients. The
mapping table of predefined topic aliases is separate from normal registered aliases. It is global and shared between all clients and gateways and may
overlap with registered aliases, since it is in a different pool.

## 4.12 Pre-defined topic alias' and short topic names {#pre-defined-topic-alias-and-short-topic-names .unnumbered}

A "pre-defined" topic alias is a topic alias who's mapping to a topic name is known in advance by both the client's application and the gateway. This
is indicated in the *Flags* field of the packet. When using pre-defined topic alias', both sides can start immediately with the sending of PUBLISH
packets; there is no need for the REGISTER procedure as in the case of "normal" topic alias'. When receiving a PUBLISH packet with a pre-defined topic
alias, of which the mapping to a topic name is unknown, the receiver should return a PUBACK with the *ReasonCode= "Unknown Topic Alias"*.

[The presence of a pre-defined topic alias does not imply any other meaning onto the topic name / topic filter itself. All lifecycle operations, for
example SUBSCRIBE / UNSUBSCRIBE may still be used in the use of these aliases except for REGISTER.]{.mark}

A "short" topic name is a topic name that has a fixed length of two bytes. It could be carried together with the data within a PUBLISH packet, thus no
REGISTER procedure is needed for a short topic name. Otherwise, all rules that apply to normal topic names also apply to short topic names. Note
however that it does not make sense to do wildcarding in subscriptions to short topic names, because it is not possible to define a meaningful name
hierarchy with only two characters.

## 4.13 Client's Topic Subscribe/Unsubscribe Procedure {#clients-topic-subscribeunsubscribe-procedure .unnumbered}

To subscribe to a topic name, a client sends a SUBSCRIBE packet to the gateway with the topic name included in that packet. If the gateway is able
accept the subscription, it assigns a topic alias to the received topic name and returns it within a SUBACK packet to the client. If the subscription
cannot be accepted, then a SUBACK packet is also returned to the client with the rejection cause encoded in the *ReasonCode* field. If the rejection
cause is *"Congestion"*, the client should wait for the time *T~WAIT\ ~*before resending the SUBSCRIBE packet to the gateway.

If the client subscribes to a topic name which contains a wildcard character, the returning SUBACK packet will contain the topic alias value 0x0000.
The GW will the use the registration procedure to inform the client about the to-be-used topic alias value when it has the first PUBLISH packet with a
matching topic name to be sent to the client.

Similar to the client's PUBLISH procedure, topic alias' may also be pre-defined for certain topic names. Short topic names may be used as well. In
those two cases the client still needs to subscribe to those pre-defined topic alias' or short topic names.

To unsubscribe, a client sends an UNSUBSCRIBE packet to the gateway, which will then be answered by means of an UNSUBACK packet.

As for the REGISTER procedure, a client may have only one SUBSCRIBE or one UNSUBSCRIBE transaction open at a time.

## 4.14 Client's Publish Procedure {#clients-publish-procedure .unnumbered}

After having registered successfully a topic name with the gateway, the client can start publishing data relating to the registered topic name by
sending PUBLISH packets to the gateway. The PUBLISH packets contain the assigned topic alias.

All three QoS levels and their corresponding packet flows are supported as defined in MQTT. The only difference is the use of topic alias' instead of
topic names in the PUBLISH packets.

Regardless of the requested QoS level the client may receive in response to its PUBLISH a PUBACK packet which contains either:

-   The *ReasonCode= "Unknown Topic Alias"*: in this case the client needs to register the topic name again before it can publish data related to that
    topic name; or

-   The *ReasonCode= "Congestion"*: in this the client shall stop publishing toward the gateway for at least the time *T~WAIT~*.

-   

At any point in time a client may have only one QoS level 1 or 2 PUBLISH packet outstanding in each direction; i.e. it has to wait for the termination
of this PUBLISH packet exchange before it could start a new level 1 or 2 transaction

## 4.15 Gateway's Publish Procedure {#gateways-publish-procedure .unnumbered}

Like the client's PUBLISH procedure described in Section 3.14, the gateway sends PUBLISH packets with the topic alias value that was returned in the
SUBACK packet to the client.

Preceding the PUBLISH packet the GW may send a REGISTER packet to inform the client about the topic name and its assigned topic alias value. This will
happen for example when the client re-connects without clean start or has subscribed to topic names with wildcard characters. Upon receiving a
REGISTER packet the client replies with a REGACK packet. The GW will wait for the REGACK packet before it sends the PUBLISH packet to the client.

The client could reject the REGISTER packet with a REGACK packet indicating the rejection reason; this corresponds to an unsubscribe to the topic name
indicated in the REGISTER packet. Note that unsubscribe to a topic name with wildcard characters can only be done with the unsubscribe procedure and
not with the rejection of a REGISTER packet, since a REGISTER packet never contains a topic name with wildcard characters.

If the client receives a PUBLISH packet with an unknown topic alias value, it shall respond with a PUBACK packet with the *ReasonCode="Unknown Topic
Alias"*. This will trigger the gateway to delete or correct the wrong topic alias assignment.

Note that in case either the topic name or the data is too long to fit into a REGISTER or a PUBLISH packet, the gateway silently aborts the publish
procedure, i.e. no warning is sent to the affected subscribers.

## 4.16 Keep Alive and PING Procedure {#keep-alive-and-ping-procedure .unnumbered}

As with MQTT, the value of the Keep Alive timer is indicated in the CONNECT packet. The client should send a PINGREQ packet within each Keep Alive
time period, which the GW acknowledges with a PINGRESP packet.

Similarly, a client shall answer with a PINGRESP packet when it receives a PINGREQ packet from the GW to which it is connected. Otherwise, the
received PINGREQ packet is ignored.

Clients should use this procedure to supervise the liveliness of the gateway to which they are connected. If a client does not receive a PINGRESP from
the gateway even after multiple retransmissions of the PINGREQ packet, it should first try to connect to another gateway before trying to reconnect to
this gateway. Note that because the clients' keep-alive timers are not synchronized with each other, in case of a gateway failure there is practically
no danger for a storm of CONNECT packets sent almost at the same time by all affected clients towards a new gateway.

## 4.17 Client's Disconnect Procedure {#clients-disconnect-procedure .unnumbered}

A client sends a DISCONNECT packet to the GW to indicate that it is about to close its Virtual Connection. After this point, the client is then
required to establish a new Virtual Connection with the GW before it can exchange information with that GW again. [Like MQTT, sending the DISCONNECT
packet does not affect existing subscriptions and Will data. They are persistent until they are either expired or explicitly un-subscribed, or
deleted, or modified by the client, or if the client establishes a new Virtual Connection with the CleanStart flag set.]{.mark} The gateway
acknowledges the receipt of the DISCONNECT packet by returning a DISCONNECT to the client.

A client may also receive an unsolicited DISCONNECT sent by the gateway. This may happen for example when the gateway, due to an error, cannot
identify the client to which a received packet belongs. Upon receiving such a DISCONNECT packet a client should retry to setup the Virtual Connection
again by sending a CONNECT packet to the gateway.

## 4.18 Client's Retransmission Procedure {#clients-retransmission-procedure .unnumbered}

All packets that are "unicasted" to the GW (i.e. sent using the GW's unicast address) and for which a GW's reply is expected are supervised by a retry
timer *T~retry\ ~*and a retry counter *N~retry~*. The retry timer *T~retry\ ~*is started by the client when the packet is sent and stopped when the
expected GW's reply is received. If *T~retry\ ~*times out and the expected GW's reply is not received, the client retransmits the packet. After
*N~retry\ ~*retransmissions, the client aborts the procedure and assumes that the MQTT-SN gateway is no longer available. It should then try to
connect to another gateway.

## 4.19 Sleeping clients {#sleeping-clients .unnumbered}

*Sleeping* clients are clients residing on (battery-operated) devices that want to save as much energy as possible. These devices need to enter a
sleep mode whenever they are not active and will wake up whenever they have data to send or to receive. The server/gateway needs to be aware of the
sleeping state of these clients and will buffer messages destined to them for later delivery when they wake up.

If a client wants to sleep, it sends a DISCONNECT packet which contains a sleep session expiry interval. The server/gateway acknowledges that packet
with a DISCONNECT packet and considers the client for being in *asleep* state. The *asleep* state is supervised by the server/gateway with the
indicated sleep session expiry interval. If the server/gateway does not receive any packet from the client for a period longer than the sleep session
expiry interval, the server/gateway will consider that client as *lost* and - as with the keep alive procedure - activates for example the Will
feature.

[During the *asleep* state, packets that need to be sent to the client are buffered at the server/gateway. The gateway MUST buffer application
messages of quality-of-service 1 & 2.]{.mark}

> **Informative comment**
>
> The gateway may *choose* to buffer messages of Quality-of-Service 0, whilst the client is sleeping and is within it's session expiry interval.

The sleep timer is stopped when the server/gateway receives a PINGREQ from the client. Like the CONNECT packet, this PINGREQ packet contains the
*Client Id*. The identified client is then in the *awake* state. If the server/gateway has buffered packets for the client, it will send these packets
to the client, acknowledging the max-receive value sent in the PINGREQ packet. If the number of messages buffered on the gateway queue exceeds the
value specified by the client in the max-receive field, the gateway shall send only the max-receive value number of messages, and cut short the AWAKE
cycle, responding with a PINGRESP with a messages-left value of either the number of messages remaining in the gateway buffer or 0xFFFF (meaning
undetermined number of messages greater than 0 remaining).

[During the AWAKE state, for each packet the gateway sends to the client, the application messages' quality of service shall be honored, and a full
packet interaction shall take place including all normative phases of acknowledgement, including any associated retransmission logic.]{.mark} If,
during the delivery of application messages from the gateway to the client, the gateway detects a timeout in the delivery, it should transition the
client state to LOST and a DISCONNECT packet with error sent to the device.

The transfer of packets to the client is closed by the server/gateway by means of a PINGRESP packet, i.e. the server/gateway will consider the client
as *asleep* and restart the sleep timer again after having sent the PINGRESP packet. If the server/gateway does not have any packets buffered for the
client, it answers immediately with a PINGRESP packet, returns the client back to the *asleep* state, and restarts the sleep timer for that client.

After having sent the PINGREQ to the server/gateway, the client uses the "retransmission procedure" of section 3.18 to supervise the arrival of
packets sent by the server/gateway, i.e. it restarts timer Tretry when it receives a packet other than a PINGRESP, and stops it when it receives a
PINGRESP. The PINGREQ packet is retransmitted, and timer Tretry restarted when timer Tretry times out. To avoid a flattening of its battery due to
excessive retransmission of the PINGREQ packet (e.g. if it loses the gateway), the client should limit the retransmission of the PINGREQ packet (e.g.
by a retry counter) and go back to sleep when the limit is reached and it still does not receive a PINGRESP packet.

From the *asleep* or *awake* state, a client can return either to the *active* state by sending a CONNECT packet or to the *disconnected* state by
sending a normal DISCONNECT packet (i.e. without session expiry interval field). The client can also modify its sleep configuration by sending a
DISCONNECT packet with a new value of the session expiry interval.

Note that a sleeping client should go the *awake* state only if it just wants to check whether the server/gateway has any messages buffered for it and
return as soon as possible to the *asleep* state without sending any packets to the server/gateway. Otherwise, it should return to the *active* state
by sending a CONNECT packet to the server/gateway.

[Topic Alias mappings exist only while a client is active and last for the entire session expiry interval of the active state.]{.mark} [Therefore, the
gateway must re-register any topic alias's during the AWAKE state, which will last until the last PINGRESP is issued.]{.mark}

> **Informative comment**
>
> The gateway should attempt to make the best effort to reuse the same topic alias' mappings that existed during any initial associated ACTIVE states.

## 4.20 Authentication {#authentication .unnumbered}

Authentication involves the exchange of AUTH packets between the Client and the Server after the CONNECT and before the CONNACK packets.

To begin an authentication exchange, the Client sets the AUTH flag in the CONNECT packet. It then sends an AUTH packet with an Authentication Method.
This specifies the authentication method to use. If the Server does not support the Authentication Method supplied by the Client, it MAY send a
CONNACK with a Reason Code of 0x8C (Bad authentication method) or 0x87 (Not Authorized) and MUST close the Connection.

The Authentication Method is an agreement between the Client and Server about the meaning of the data sent in the Authentication Data and any of the
other fields in CONNECT, and the exchanges and processing needed by the Client and Server to complete the authentication.

> **Informative comment**
>
> The Authentication Method is commonly a SASL mechanism, using such a registered name aids interchange. However, the Authentication Method is not
> constrained to using registered SASL mechanisms.
>
> If the Authentication Method selected by the Client specifies that the Client sends data first, the Client SHOULD include an Authentication Data
> property in the AUTH packet. This property can be used to provide data as specified by the Authentication Method. The contents of the Authentication
> Data are defined by the authentication method.
>
> If the Gateway requires additional information to complete the authentication, it can send an AUTH packet to the Client. This packet MUST contain a
> Reason Code of 0x18 (Continue authentication). If the authentication method requires the Gateway to send authentication data to the Client, it is
> sent in the Authentication Data.
>
> The Client responds to an AUTH packet from the Gateway by sending a further AUTH packet. This packet MUST contain a Reason Code of 0x18 (Continue
> authentication). If the authentication method requires the Client to send authentication data for the Gateway, it is sent in the Authentication
> Data.
>
> The Client and Server exchange AUTH packets as needed until the Gateway accepts the authentication by sending a CONNACK with a Reason Code of 0. If
> the acceptance of the authentication requires data to be sent to the Client, it is sent in the Authentication Data.
>
> The Client can close the Virtual Connection at any point in this process by sending a DISCONNECT packet. The Server can reject the authentication at
> any point in this process by sending a CONNACK with a Reason Code of 0x80 or above as described in section 4.13.
>
> The implementation of authentication is OPTIONAL for both Clients and Gateways. If the Client does not include an Authentication Method in the
> CONNECT, the Gateway MUST NOT send an AUTH packet. If the Client does not set the Authentication Flag in the CONNECT, the Client MUST NOT send an
> AUTH packet to the Server.
>
> If the Client does not set the Authentication Flag in the CONNECT packet, the Server SHOULD authenticate using some or all of the information in the
> CONNECT packet in conjunction with the underlying transport layer.
>
> **Informative example showing a user name and password authentication**:
>
> Â· Client to Gateway: CONNECT Authentication Flag=1 Authentication Data=client-first-data
>
> Â· Client to Gateway: AUTH rc=0x01 Authentication Method=\"PLAIN\" Authentication Data=client-first-data
>
> Â· Gateway to Gateway CONNACK rc=0

Where client-first data is the content of the SASL PLAIN message as described in RFC 4616:

*The mechanism consists of a single message, a string ofÂ \[UTF-8\]*Â *encodedÂ \[Unicode\]Â characters, from the client to the server.
The\[UTF-8\]*Â *client presents the authorization identity (identity to act as),*Â *followed by a NUL (U+0000) character, followed by the
authentication*Â *identity (identity whose password will be used), followed by a NUL*Â *(U+0000) character, followed by the clear-text password. As
with*Â *other SASL mechanisms, the client does not provide an authorization identity when it wishes the server to derive an identity from the*
*credentials and use that as the authorization identity.*

## 4.21 Retained Packets {#retained-packets .unnumbered}

If the RETAIN flag is set to 1 in a PUBLISH packet sent by a Client to a Server, the Server MUST replace any existing retained packet for this topic
and store the Publish Data, so that it can be delivered to future subscribers whose subscriptions match its Topic Name. If the Publish Data contains
zero bytes it is processed normally by the Server but any retained packet with the same topic name MUST be removed and any future subscribers for the
topic will not receive a retained packet. A retained packet with Publish Data containing zero bytes MUST NOT be stored as a retained packet on the
Server.

## 4.22 Optional Features {#optional-features .unnumbered}

The ADVERTISE, SEARCHGW and GWINFO packet type support is optional. For instance, it is not required if the MQTT-SN Gateway is an Internet node
reachable via a public IP address.

The Forwarder Encapsulation packet type support is optional. For instance, it is not required if the MQTT-SN Clients are able to reach directly a
MQTT-SN Gateway.

The PROTECTION packet type support is optional. For instance, it is not required if the MQTT-SN Gateway and the MQTT-SN Clients interact over a secure
communication channel, like DTLS or any communication channel assuring the authenticity and optionally the confidentiality protection.

# 5 Conformance {#conformance .unnumbered}

# Appendix B. Security and Privacy Considerations {#appendix-b.-security-and-privacy-considerations .unnumbered}

\[[Optional section.]{.mark}\]

[Note: OASIS strongly recommends that Technical Committees consider issues that might affect safety, security, privacy, and/or data protection in
implementations of their work products and document these for implementers and adopters. For some purposes, you may find it required, e.g. if you
apply for IANA registration.]{.mark}

[While it may not be immediately obvious how your work product might make systems vulnerable to attack, most work products, because they involve
communications between systems, message formats, or system settings, open potential channels for exploit. For example, IETF \[RFC3552\] lists
"eavesdropping, replay, message insertion, deletion, modification, and man-in-the-middle" as well as potential denial of service attacks as threats
that must be considered and, if appropriate, addressed in IETF RFCs.]{.mark}

[In addition to considering and describing foreseeable risks, this section should include guidance on how implementers and adopters can protect
against these risks.]{.mark}

[We encourage editors and TC members concerned with this subject to read Guidelines for Writing RFC Text on Security Considerations, IETF \[RFC3552\],
for more information.]{.mark}

The MQTT SN protocol is optimized for implementation on low-cost, battery-powered devices with limited processing and storage resources. The
capabilities are kept simple and the specification allows for partial implementations. Device identities are typically created at manufacturing,
eliminating the need for special configuration at deployment. MQTT-SN can work in isolation from other networks or in conjunction with MQTT.

MQTT-SN Client and Gateway/Server implementations SHOULD offer Authentication and Authorization options. Furthermore, the confidentiality and
authenticity of the MQTT-SN messages can be provided by the underlying transport or can be obtained by encapsulating the MQTT-SN messages into the
PROTECTION packet.

Applications concerned with critical infrastructure, personally identifiable information, or other personal or sensitive information are strongly
advised to use these security capabilities.

> **Industry specific security profiles**

It is anticipated that the MQTT protocol will be designed into industry specific application profiles, each defining a threat model and the specific
security mechanisms to be used to address these threats. Recommendations for specific security mechanisms will often be taken from existing works
including:

[\[NISTCSF\]](#bookmark=id.2pcmsun) NIST Cyber Security Framework

[\[NIST7628\]](#bookmark=id.14hx32g) NISTIR 7628 Guidelines for Smart Grid Cyber Security

##  E.1 Support of QoS Level -1 and OUT OF BAND {#e.1-support-of-qos-level--1-and-out-of-band .unnumbered}

Because PUBLISH packets with QoS level -1 and OUT OF BAND could be sent at any time by clients (even with no Virtual Connection setup) a transparent
GW needs to maintain for those packets a dedicated MQTT connection with the server. An aggregating or hybrid GW may use any aggregating MQTT
connection to forward those packets to the server.

Table 30: "Best practice" values for timers and counters

The "tolerance" of the sleep and keep-alive timers at the server/gateway depends on the values indicated by the clients. For example, the timer values
should be 10% higher than the indicated values for periods larger than 1 minute, and 50% higher if less.

## E.3 Mapping of Topic Alias to Topic Names and Topic Filters {#e.3-mapping-of-topic-alias-to-topic-names-and-topic-filters .unnumbered}

It is strongly recommended that in the gateway the mapping table between topic alias and topic names is implemented per client (and not by a single
shared pool between all clients), to reduce the risk of an incorrect topic alias from a client matching another client's valid topic, and thus causing
a publication to the wrong topic, which could potentially have disastrous consequences.

## E.4 Exponential Backoff {#e.4-exponential-backoff .unnumbered}

The following error handling strategy should be used for networked devices to avoid overwhelming recipient network entities whilst providing for
efficient reestablishment handling. The client shall periodically retry a failed packet with increasing delays between attempts, constrained by a max
retry time and interleaved with a suitable seed of randomness.

**Algorithm:**

An exponential backoff algorithm retries requests exponentially, increasing the waiting time between retries up to a maximum backoff time. For
example:

1.  Initial packet sent.

2.  If the operation fails, wait 1000 + (random number) milliseconds (ran) and retry the operation.

3.  If the operation fails, wait 2000 + (random number) milliseconds (ran) and retry the operation.

4.  If the operation fails, wait 4000 + (random number) milliseconds (ran) and retry the operation.

5.  Continued, up to a maximum backoff (max) time.

6.  Continue waiting and retrying up to some maximum number of retries, but do not increase the wait period between retries.

The wait time is [min(((2\^n \* sf) + ran), max)]{.mark} with n incremented by 1 for each iteration (or operation) and the scaling factor (sf) being
set to some reasonable value (suggested 1000 as in the example above).

The random number helps to avoid cases where many clients are synchronized by some situation, and all retry at once. The value of random number ran is
recalculated after each retry. The random number (ran) should be no larger than the scaling factor (sf).

this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable, to notify OASIS TC Administrator and provide an indication of its willingness to grant patent licenses to such
patent claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that produced this deliverable.\]

\[OASIS invites any party to contact the OASIS TC Administrator if it is aware of a claim of ownership of any patent claims that would necessarily be
infringed by implementations of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable by a patent holder that is not willing to provide a license to such patent
claims in a manner consistent with the IPR Mode of the OASIS Technical Committee that produced this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable. OASIS may
include such claims on its website, but disclaims any obligation to do so.\]

\[OASIS takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to pertain to the
implementation or use of the technology described in this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable or the extent to which any license under such rights might
or might not be available; neither does it represent that it has made any effort to identify any such rights. Information on OASIS\' procedures with
respect to rights in any document or deliverable produced by an OASIS Technical Committee can be found on the OASIS website. Copies of claims of
rights made available for publication and any assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to obtain a general
license or permission for the use of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this OASIS Standards Final Deliverable, can be obtained from
the OASIS TC Administrator. OASIS makes no representation that any information or list of intellectual property rights will at any time be complete,
or that any claims in such list are, in fact, Essential Claims.\]
