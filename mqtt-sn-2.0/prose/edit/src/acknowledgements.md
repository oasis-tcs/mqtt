# Acknowledgments

<!--
[Required section.]
Note: A Work Product approved by the TC must include a list of people who participated in the
development of the Work Product. This is generally done by collecting the list of names in this appendix.
This list shall be initially compiled by the Chair, and any Member of the TC may add or remove their
names from the list by request.
Remove these notes within an html comment before submitting for publication.

## Special Thanks{#acknowledgments--special-thanks}

<!--
Note: This is an optional subsection to call out contributions from TC members.
If a TC wants to thank non-TC members then they should avoid using the term "contribution" and
instead thank them for their "expertise" or "assistance".
-->
Substantial contributions to this document from the following individuals are gratefully acknowledged:

| First Name | Last Name | Affiliation                |

## Participants{#acknowledgments--participants}

<!--
Note: A TC can determine who they list here, however, Observers must not be listed.
It is common practice for TCs to list everyone that was part of the TC during the creation of the document,
but this is ultimately a TC decision on who they want to list and not list.
