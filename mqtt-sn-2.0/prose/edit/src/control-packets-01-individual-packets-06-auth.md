### 3.1.6 AUTH

![AUTH Packet](images/packet/auth.png "AUTH Packet"){#fig:auth-packet}

[The authentication method and data is first sent by the Client as part of a CONNECT exchange.Â If the Server requires additional information to
complete the authentication, it responds with an AUTH packet to signal that the Client generates and sends another AUTH packet with the required
information and so on until the authentication is complete. The server then responds with a CONNACK message.]{.mark}

#### 3.1.6.1 Length &amp; Packet Type{#auth--length-and-packet-type}

#### 3.1.6.2 Packet Identifier{#auth--packet-identifier}

Used to identify the corresponding CONNECT, AUTH or CONNACK packet. It should ideally be populated with a random integer value when sent from Client

<!-- transformation-note: the below table ref upstream 9 "Reason Code Values" needs verification before transforming into a semantic ref later. -->
<!-- fixed error from upstream: The byte 3 is not anymore holding the auth reason code, but instead byte 5 -->
[Byte 5 in the Auth packet holds the Authentication Reason Code. The values for the Authentication Reason Code field are shown in]{.mark} Table 9:
Reason Code Values. [The sender of the AUTH Packet MUST use one of the Authenticate Reason Codes.]{.mark}
