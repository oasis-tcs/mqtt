# Prose Sources (Experimental)

This is the markdown format trial for the prose of the MQTT-SN v2.0 specification work product.

The main goal of this trial is to provide a markdown version.

It is only a secondary goal in this stage 1 of the experiment to reflect the latest agreed content from the editor document version.
The editor document version is currently hosted on google drive and occasionally published per the OASIS workspace document repository.

If the stage 1 experiment is complete, the content will strive to follow the live editor version as close as possible
eventually replacing the google hosted closed document to offer more trqnsparency and accelerate the final stages of standards creation.

## Contributing (for editors and TC members)

This is a repository for OASIS MQTT TC work governed by the OASIS IPR rules.
Thus the following instructions on how to edit the sources and generate matching delivery items to be consumed by readers only applies to members of the TC.
