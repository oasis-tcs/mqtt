# 5 Conformance

<!--
(Note: The OASIS TC Process requires that a specification approved by the TC at the Committee Specification Public
Review Draft, Committee Specification or OASIS Standard level must include a separate section, listing a set of numbered
conformance clauses, to which any implementation of the specification must adhere in order to claim conformance to the
specification (or any optional portion thereof). This is done by listing the conformance clauses here.

For the definition of "conformance clause," see OASIS Defined Terms.
