#### Abstract:
This specification defines the MQTT for Sensor Networks protocol (MQTT-SN).
It is closely related to the MQTT v3.1.1 and MQTT v5.0 standards.
MQTT-SN is optimized for implementation on low-cost, battery-operated devices with limited processing and storage resources.
It is designed so that it will work over a variety of networking technologies and bridge to an MQTT network.
